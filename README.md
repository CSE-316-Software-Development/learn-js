variables declared by let cannot be accessed outside the block,
variables declared by var can be accessed outside the block

block: different layers of scopes

var variable declarations are hoisted to the top of the block so it's ok
to access a var variable before declaring them

const: can change the values inside the reference (something inside the array)
but cannot change the reference object
